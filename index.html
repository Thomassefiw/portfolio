        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p>
          I am a web developer with a bachelor’s degree in computer science from
          Arba Minch University, one of the leading universities in Ethiopia. I
          have skills and experience in using the most popular web development
          tools and languages, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL,
          WordPress, Bootstrap, jQuery, React, VS Code, Chrome DevTools, and
          Git. I can create and maintain websites that are responsive,
          interactive, and user-friendly.

          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>
            I have web development skills that allow me to create and maintain
            websites using various technologies and tools. I have experience in
            using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design and code the front-end of
            websites, as well as Node.js, MySQL, and WordPress to develop and
            manage the back-end of websites. I can also use frameworks and
            libraries, such as Bootstrap, jQuery, and React, to enhance the
            functionality and appearance of websites. I can use web development
            tools, such as VS Code, Chrome DevTools, and Git, to edit, debug,
            and deploy websites. I have a portfolio of websites that I have
            created or contributed to, which demonstrate my web development
            skills.

          <h3>Bicycle Riding challenge</h3>
          <p>
            I enjoy riding a bicycle as a hobby and a form of exercise. I have
            been riding a bicycle since I was a child, and I have learned how to
            balance, steer, brake, and pedal with ease and confidence. I can
            ride a bicycle on different terrains, such as roads, trails, hills,
            and parks. I can also ride a bicycle in different weather
            conditions, such as sunny, rainy, or windy. I always wear a helmet
            and follow the traffic rules when I ride a bicycle. Riding a bicycle
            is fun, healthy, and eco-friendly, and I am proud of my skills in
            this activity.
